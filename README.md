I'm Raphael (@FlMonkey). Currently looking to apply my computer science skills to my courses at McGill University.
I know Python, Java and some Flutterflow CSS (I mainly use it with Flask).
I would love to get good at Swift soon and make some IOS apps. 
If you have any questions about anything send me a message on discord: @Bjol
